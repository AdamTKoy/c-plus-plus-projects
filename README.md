# C++ Projects

This repository contains several projects that explore the fundamentals of programming in C++, and demonstrate an understanding of:
* working with various types of data structures (linked lists, 2D arrays, etc.)
* data encapsulation through classes and structs
* working with strings (manipulation, parsing, validation)
* passing arguments by reference and by value
* working with command line arguments
* working with enums
* working with dynamic memory and preventing memory leaks
* reading from and writing to a file using file streams
* dynamic programming
* unit testing
